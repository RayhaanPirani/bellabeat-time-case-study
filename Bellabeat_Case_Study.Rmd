### 📕 About the company

Urška Sršen and Sando Mur founded Bellabeat, a high-tech company that manufactures health-focused smart products. Sršen used her background as an artist to develop beautifully designed technology that informs and inspires women around the world. Collecting data on activity, sleep, stress, and reproductive health has allowed Bellabeat to empower women with knowledge about their own health and habits. Since it was founded in 2013, Bellabeat has grown rapidly and quickly positioned itself as a tech-driven wellness company for women.

By 2016, Bellabeat had opened offices around the world and launched multiple products. Bellabeat products became available through a growing number of online retailers in addition to their own e-commerce channel on their website. The company has invested in traditional advertising media, such as radio, out-of-home billboards, print, and television, but focuses on digital marketing extensively. Bellabeat invests year-round in Google Search, maintaining active Facebook and Instagram pages, and consistently engages consumers on Twitter. Additionally, Bellabeat runs video ads on YouTube and display ads on the Google Display Network to support campaigns around key marketing dates.

Sršen knows that an analysis of Bellabeat's available consumer data would reveal more opportunities for growth. She has asked the marketing analytics team to focus on a Bellabeat product and analyze smart device usage data in order to gain insight into how people are already using their smart devices. Then, using this information, she would like high-level recommendations for how these trends can inform Bellabeat marketing strategy.

We follow the data analysis process using the following order:

**Ask -\> Prepare -\> Process -\> Analyze -\> Share -\> Act**

### 🤔 Ask

In this section, we identify the business task and consider key stakeholders.

The following are the questions we may ask:

1.  What are some trends in smart device usage? 📈

2.  How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers? 🛍️

3.  How could these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy? 💬

**Business Task Statement:** Using current trends in smart-watch usage data, identify how these trends relate to Bellabeat customers, and consequently identify how this may influence the Bellabeat marketing strategy.

### 📝 Prepare

We download, store, and prepare our dataset, and determine if it is appropriate for our analysis in this step.

The dataset that we choose is [FitBit Fitness Tracker Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit "FitBit Fitness Tracker Data") provided by the user [Möbius](https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic "Möbius") in the Kaggle dataset repository. It contains personal fitness tracker from thirty fitbit users. Thirty eligible Fitbit users consented to the submission of personal tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. It includes information about daily activity, steps, and heart rate that can be used to explore users' habits.

#### 🗄️ Data storage and organization

The data is stored in the form of multiple CSV files. There are CSV files for all activity (by day), steps taken, calories burned, activity intensity (by day, hour and minute), heart-rate (by seconds), sleep (days and minutes), METs (minutes), and weight logs (day of weighing). The data for steps taken, calories burned, activity intensity also have both the long and wide variants of data available. All other data are in long format only.

#### 👍 How "good" is this data? How useful is it for our analysis?

We now see if this dataset meets the ROCCC principles.

This dataset was generated by respondents to a distributed survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk between 03.12.2016-05.12.2016. Thirty eligible Fitbit users consented to the submission of personal tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. Individual reports can be parsed by export session ID (column A) or timestamp (column B).

**👌 Reliability:** Considering the methodology of data gathering, this data was directly obtained from FitBit devices of consenting Amazon Mechanical Turk survey respondents and can thus be considered reliable fitness data.

**✨ Originality:** This dataset was indepedently obtained via a distributed survey and is original.

**🌐 Comprehensiveness:** As discussed in the previous section, this data has comprehensive attributes that measure fitness tracker data collection.

**🌟 Current:** The data was collected in 2016 and is contemporary. However, the insights derived from these data may not be relevant to the current post-pandemic fitness market.

**🔎 Cited:** The dataset is widely used for analytical purposes and has been used in almost 3,000 notebooks on Kaggle alone.

We can derive some general insights around smart-watch usage from this data. However, we should consider the limitations that this data has while determining our plan of action.

#### 🧩 Other problems and considerations

**🧪 Sample size:** The sample size is only of 30 people and may not reflect the general population accurately.

**📜 Licensing:** The data is licensed under the Creative Commons [CC0: Public Domain](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) license and can be used for our analysis, since it is a publicly accessible dataset.

**🔐 Privacy and security:** The survey respondents do not reveal any personal information that could be used to identify them. There is no privacy or security concern with this dataset.

**👩‍🦽 Accessibility and integrity:** The dataset has a lot of information and may be hard to read at glance. We shall convert it to a format that is more accessible by merging it into a single dataset with all attributes by day.

### ⚙️ Process

We load the required libraries to prepare our data.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

#### 📁 Base dataset

We read the `dailyActivity_merged.csv` file and analyze the columns.

```{r}
daily_activity_df <- read_csv('data/fitbit_data/dailyActivity_merged.csv')
head(daily_activity_df)
```

```{r}
colnames(daily_activity_df)
```

#### 🗂️ Other datasets

The dataset has the ID for each respondent, activity date, step data, distance, intensity, activity minutes, and calories burned. However, this dataset is missing heart rate information, sleep data, and weight logs.

We shall now merge this information to `daily_activity_df`.

```{r}
heartrate_df <- read_csv("data/fitbit_data/heartrate_seconds_merged.csv")
head(heartrate_df)
```

We notice that we have the heart rate for every few seconds. To merge with `daily_activity_df`, we require that the data be averaged over by day.

We shall now create a `Date` column, group the data by `Date`, average the heart rate `Value` to get the resultant dataset that can be merged with `daily_activity_df`.

```{r}
heartrate_dates <- str_split_fixed(heartrate_df$Time, " ", 2)[,1]
heartrate_df$Date <- heartrate_dates
head(heartrate_df)
```

```{r}
heartrate_grouped_df <- heartrate_df %>% 
  group_by(Id, Date) %>% 
  summarise(AvgHeartRate = mean(Value))
head(heartrate_grouped_df)
```

Now, we load and verify the sleep data.

```{r}
sleep_df <- read_csv("data/fitbit_data/sleepDay_merged.csv")
head(sleep_df)
```

We convert the `SleepDay` column from date-time format to date, since it has only the time `12:00:00 AM` for all the days.

```{r}
sleep_df$Date <- str_split_fixed(sleep_df$SleepDay, " ", 2)[,1]
sleep_df <- select(sleep_df, -SleepDay)
head(sleep_df)
```

Now, we load and verify the weight log info.

```{r}
weight_log_df <- read_csv("data/fitbit_data/weightLogInfo_merged.csv")
head(weight_log_df)
```

The respondents weighed themselves only once per day at around the same time. So the time when they weighed themselves is not relevant. We remove the time and retain the dates.

```{r}
weight_log_df$Date <- str_split_fixed(weight_log_df$Date, " ", 2)[,1]
head(weight_log_df)
```

#### 🔗 Combining datasets

We now merge `heartrate_grouped_df`, `sleep_df`, and `weight_log_df` to `daily_activity_df`.

```{r}
daily_activity_df_merged <- daily_activity_df %>% 
  left_join(heartrate_grouped_df, by = join_by(Id == Id, ActivityDate == Date)) %>% 
  left_join(sleep_df, by = join_by(Id == Id, ActivityDate == Date)) %>% 
  left_join(weight_log_df, by = join_by(Id == Id, ActivityDate == Date)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(Calories))

head(daily_activity_df_merged)
```

We now have all kinds of data in one data frame.

**Limitations:** We observe that there are some missing values for heart rate, sleep information, and weight data. This may be because:

-   Not all FitBit devices have a heart rate monitor.

-   Not all FitBit devices measure sleep.

-   Some users charge their FitBit smart-watch overnight and thus the device does not measure sleep data.

-   Some users do not weigh regularly.

-   Some users weighing scale does not measure body fat.

### 🧠 Analyze

#### 🛠️ Preparing data

To make our analysis effective, let us categorize users based on their activity and their sleep.

```{r}
daily_activity_df_merged <- daily_activity_df_merged %>%
  mutate(UserActivityType = case_when(
      VeryActiveMinutes > mean(VeryActiveMinutes) ~ "Very Active",
      FairlyActiveMinutes > mean(FairlyActiveMinutes) ~ "Fairly Active",
      LightlyActiveMinutes > mean(LightlyActiveMinutes) ~ "Lightly Active",
      SedentaryMinutes > mean(SedentaryMinutes) ~ "Sedentary"
    )
  ) %>% 
  mutate(UserSleepType = case_when(
      TotalMinutesAsleep < 5*60 ~ "Light",
      TotalMinutesAsleep > 5*60 & TotalMinutesAsleep < 7*60 ~ "Moderate",
      TotalMinutesAsleep > 7*60 ~ "Heavy"
    )
  )

head(daily_activity_df_merged)
```

Let us also convert the date column from `chr` to `date` type.

```{r}
daily_activity_df_merged$ActivityDate <- as.Date(daily_activity_df_merged$ActivityDate, "%m/%d/%Y")
head(daily_activity_df_merged)
```

#### ⏳ Time series analysis

Let us visualize how the calories burned in general relate with time.

```{r}
ggplot(daily_activity_df_merged, aes(x=ActivityDate, y=Calories)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_smooth() +
  xlab('Activity Date')
```

We note that the respondents have had a consistent exercise schedule with rest days and active days.

Let us analyze how this relationship work with respect to user activity type.

```{r}
ggplot(daily_activity_df_merged, aes(x=ActivityDate, y=Calories)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_smooth() +
  facet_wrap(~UserActivityType) +
  xlab('Activity Date')
```

We observe that active users, even if moderately active, were still consistently active, while sedentary and lightly active users demonstrated drop in activity at the beginning of May.

*The less active the user, the higher their chance to lose motivation to burn calories consistently.*

#### 🖇️ Finding correlations

We plot the relationship between calories, total steps, and total distance.

```{r}
ggplot(daily_activity_df_merged) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x=TotalSteps, y=Calories, color=TotalDistance)) +
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x=TotalSteps, y=Calories)) +
  labs(title = 'Relationship between steps, calories, and distance',
       subtitle = 'The longer the distance walked and steps taken, the more the calories burned',
       x = 'Total Steps',
       color = 'Total Distance')
```

We see that the three variables above are correlated.

#### Activity and sleep patterns

```{r}
daily_activity_df_merged %>%
  select(Id, UserActivityType) %>%
  drop_na() %>% 
  group_by(Id) %>% 
  slice(1) %>% 
  ggplot() +
    geom_bar(mapping = aes(x=UserActivityType, fill=UserActivityType)) +
    labs(x = '', fill = 'User type')
```

Very active users (by time) tend to use smart-watches more followed by fairly active users. Let us analyze the same with sleep patterns of users.

```{r}
daily_activity_df_merged %>%
  select(Id, UserSleepType) %>%
  drop_na() %>% 
  group_by(Id) %>% 
  slice(1) %>% 
  ggplot() +
    geom_bar(mapping = aes(x=UserSleepType, fill=UserSleepType)) +
    labs(x = '', fill = 'User sleep pattern')
```

Most sleepers have a heavy sleeping pattern (i.e., they sleep for more than 7 hours/day).

Let us compare the calories vs. step count relationship based on user type.

```{r}
ggplot(drop_na(daily_activity_df_merged, UserActivityType)) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x=TotalSteps, y=Calories, color=UserActivityType)) +
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x=TotalSteps, y=Calories)) +
  labs(title = 'Relationship between steps, calories, and user activity type',
       subtitle = 'More active users burned more calories',
       x = 'Total Steps',
       color = 'User activity type')
```

#### 😴 Do active users get good sleep?

```{r}
ggplot(daily_activity_df_merged) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x=TotalMinutesAsleep, y=Calories, color=UserActivityType)) +
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x=TotalMinutesAsleep, y=Calories)) +
  labs(title = 'Relationship between sleep and activity',
       x = 'Total Minutes Asleep',
       color = 'User activity type')
```

Active respondents had moderate sleep levels. Let us go into more detail with the categorization.

```{r}
ggplot(daily_activity_df_merged) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x=TotalMinutesAsleep, y=Calories)) +
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x=TotalMinutesAsleep, y=Calories)) +
  facet_wrap(~UserActivityType)
  labs(title = 'Relationship between sleep and activity',
       x = 'Total Minutes Asleep')
```

Sedentary respondents had the worst sleep in general. Respondents with even a little activity had better sleep.

### 📺 Share

These are the following plots we can share with the stakeholders.

#### 🏃🏻 Active metrics are correlated

```{r}
ggplot(drop_na(daily_activity_df_merged, UserActivityType)) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x=TotalSteps, y=Calories, color=UserActivityType)) +
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x=TotalSteps, y=Calories)) +
  labs(title = 'Relationship between steps, calories, and user activity type',
       subtitle = 'More active users burned more calories',
       x = 'Total Steps',
       color = 'User activity type',
       caption = 'Based on FitBit data by 33 survey respondents for April-May 2016')
```

The graph shows the relationship between the steps, calories, and user activity type.

It essentially says that active users take more steps in a day and also burn more calories.

#### ❤️ Smart-watches are popular among healthy users

```{r}
daily_activity_df_merged %>%
  select(Id, UserActivityType) %>%
  drop_na() %>% 
  group_by(Id) %>% 
  slice(1) %>% 
  ggplot() +
    geom_bar(mapping = aes(x=UserActivityType, fill=UserActivityType)) +
    labs(title = 'Users by activity type',
         x = '',
         fill = 'User activity type',
         caption = 'Based on FitBit data by 33 survey respondents for April-May 2016')
```

```{r}
daily_activity_df_merged %>%
  select(Id, UserSleepType) %>%
  drop_na() %>% 
  group_by(Id) %>% 
  ggplot() +
    geom_bar(mapping = aes(x=UserSleepType, fill=UserSleepType)) +
    labs(x = '', fill = 'User sleep pattern',
         caption = 'Based on FitBit data by 33 survey respondents for April-May 2016')
```

This chart shows that more active users are likely to use and report fitness data. Active users are more interested in smart-watches. Similarly, these users also in general have better sleep.

*Smart-watch customers tend to be healthier and sleep well.*

#### 🥱 Active smart-watch users sleep better

```{r}
daily_activity_df_merged %>%
  drop_na(UserActivityType) %>%
ggplot() +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x=TotalMinutesAsleep, y=Calories)) +
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x=TotalMinutesAsleep, y=Calories)) +
  facet_wrap(~UserActivityType)
  labs(title = 'Relationship between sleep and activity',
         caption = 'Based on FitBit data by 33 survey respondents for April-May 2016')
```

Active users sleep better than sedentary ones.

#### 🏋🏼‍♂️ Consistency

```{r}
daily_activity_df_merged %>%
  select(Id, UserActivityType, ActivityDate, Calories) %>%
  drop_na() %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=ActivityDate, y=Calories)) +
    geom_smooth() +
    facet_wrap(~UserActivityType) +
    labs(title = 'Calories lost with time',
         subtitle = 'Active users are consistent and lose more calories',
         x='Activity Date',
         caption = 'Based on FitBit data by 33 survey respondents for April-May 2016')
```

Active users consistently lose calories, lose more calories, and are consistent over time.

#### ⛱️ Activity on weekends

```{r}
daily_activity_df_merged_wd <- daily_activity_df_merged %>% 
  select(Id, ActivityDate, TotalSteps, Calories)

daily_activity_df_merged_wd$ActivityWeekday <- weekdays(daily_activity_df_merged_wd$ActivityDate)

head(daily_activity_df_merged_wd)
```

```{r}
daily_activity_df_merged_wd_summarized <- daily_activity_df_merged_wd %>% 
  select(Id, ActivityWeekday, TotalSteps, Calories) %>% 
  group_by(ActivityWeekday) %>% 
  summarize(TotalStepsWeekday = sum(TotalSteps),
            CaloriesWeekday = sum(Calories))

daily_activity_df_merged_wd_summarized$ActivityWeekday <- factor(daily_activity_df_merged_wd_summarized$ActivityWeekday, levels= c("Monday", 
    "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday"))
daily_activity_df_merged_wd_summarized <- daily_activity_df_merged_wd_summarized[order(daily_activity_df_merged_wd_summarized$ActivityWeekday), ]

daily_activity_df_merged_wd_summarized %>% 
  ggplot() +
    geom_bar(stat='identity',
      mapping = aes(x=ActivityWeekday, y=CaloriesWeekday, fill=ActivityWeekday)) +
    labs(x = '', y='Calories burned', fill = 'Day of week',
         title = 'Calories burned by weekday',
         caption = 'Based on FitBit data by 33 survey respondents for April-May 2016')
```

Respondents lost less calories on weekends compared to weekdays. Surprisingly, they also lost less calories on Monday as compared to other weekdays.

In general, the amount of calories burned kept declining as the weekend approached and reset every Tuesday.

### 🎬 Act

Based on our analysis of FitBit data, to market Bellabeat Time, we suggest the following actions to be taken by the stakeholders:

1.  There is a **strong correlation** among the features **calories burned, steps walked, and activity**. These statistics may be used to encourage potential future users to stay more active. 💪🏼
2.  The majority of people who owned FitBit, a product similar to Bellabeat Time, exhibited higher activity, lost more calories, walked more steps, and had better sleep quality. **An advertising campaign suggesting that smart-watch users tend to be more active and healthier can be used to market Bellabeat Time**. 🎯
3.  Active smart-watch users tend to have a higher sleep quality than sedentary users. **Improved sleep quality can be marketed as a side-effect of owning a Bellabeat Time device**. 💤
4.  Active users consistently lose calories, lose more calories, and are consistent over time. Sedentary users tend to lose motivation. **Active smart-watch users tend to be more consistent with burning calories can also be used in the campaign**. 🚀
5.  Users tend to lose motivation as the weekend approaches and stay motivated until the Monday of the coming week. **A feature encouraging walking more steps during weekends could be added to Bellabeat Time and marketed**. ✈️

This section concludes the data analysis process of this project.
